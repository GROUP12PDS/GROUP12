# Unemployment and Inflation Rate in Malaysia
This project intends to give a complete analysis of Malaysian inflation and unemployment rates to provide a nuanced understanding of the trends, patterns, and relationships between these two vital economic variables. This analysis will make use of a variety of statistical and data analysis techniques, including descriptive analysis, time-series analysis, dynamic time warping, box plot analysis and correlation analysis.

# Project Overview
The Jupyter notebook is part of the "Inflation and Unemployment in the Next Decade" project for the course WQD7001 PRINCIPLES OF DATA SCIENCE, Group 12. It focuses on the development of prediction models to understand and manage inflation and unemployment rates in Malaysia for the coming decade.

# Purpose
The purpose of this notebook is to:

-Import and preprocess economic data for Malaysia.

-Analyze historical data on inflation rate, unemployment rate, GDP growth, and other related indicators. 

-Develop statistical models for predicting future trends in these areas. 

-Provide insights and forecasts that can aid in policy formulation and economic stability.

# Contents

1. Imported Raw Data

2. Data Import and Preprocessing

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

4. Model Development and Validation

5. Forecasting and Interpretation

6. Conclusion and Policy Implications

# How to Use

-Recommended to use Google Colab for seamless execution.

-Mount Google Drive to access the dataset.

-Execute the cells in sequential order for analysis.

-Adjust parameters or datasets as needed for specific analyses.

# Required Libraries
To run this notebook, the following libraries are required:

-dtw 

-fastdtw

-google.colab (for Google Colab users)

-scipy, including scipy.spatial.distance

-statsmodels

-matplotlib.pyplot
